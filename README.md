# Encoding-Wizard
This C++ program provides a versatile tool for exploring character encodings. It allows users to examine the different encoding representations (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) of individual characters, convert entire strings to their ASCII values, and view a list of common symbols along with their encoding details.
